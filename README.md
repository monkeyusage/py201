# py201: python programming

*This class is designed to provide students with basic knowledge about the main analytics libraries that the python ecosystem has.*

We assume basic knowledge about python programming: functions, loops, file manipulation

We recommend downloading VS Code for the class, when downloaded add the "python" and "pylance" plugins.

To make your eyes more comfortable chose a dark theme.

There are 5 sessions. The outline of the class is the following:

    - Numerical Computing with numpy (numerical library). Challenge: pythonic code
    - Tabular data manipulation with pandas (dataframe / tabular data library). Challenge: data exploration
    - Plotting and Intro to Machine Learning with matplotlib (plotting library) and sci-kit learn (machine learning library). Challenge: simple modeling 
    - More machine learning with sci-kit learn and Intro to numerical optimization. Challenge: efficient model training 
    - final project presentation


### Installation

To install the required libraries for the class we create a virtual environment. A closed sandbox with isolated python version and packages.

On mac/linux run `bash unixinstall.sh`

On windows run `python wininstall.py`
